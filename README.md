## Getting Started with React Project.

#### These are the steps to Setup React Project:
**Step 1.** Ensure that you have the most recent version of Node installed. If not, visit ``` https://nodejs.org/en/download``` to download and install the LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.  

**Step 2.** Verify that you have the latest version of VSCode. If you donâ€™t, go to ``` https://code.visualstudio.com/download ``` to get the version suitable for your operating system.  
    
**Step 3.** Open a Terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you want to set up your React project. 
  
**Step 4.** Generate a Vite application by executing the following command in your Terminal or Command Prompt:
```http
  npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react
```
**Step 5.** Since Vite isn't installed initially, type y to continue with the setup. Next, you'll be prompted to choose a framework. Use the down arrow key to select React.

**Step 7.** Then wait for the installation to finish, this will take a few minutes.  Change directory to the new app that you built.  
```http
  cd my-react-app
```

Once npm has finished installing all the required packages, open your project directory in VS Code. You should find a node_modules folder inside.

**Step 9.** Start the development server:  

```http
npm run dev  
```

Vite automatically recompiles your code whenever you make changes, and the output will display the address of your development server.  

**Step 10.** Launch the app in your browser by navigating to the local address provided. This is typically http://localhost:5173/.

You can now work on this local version, and Vite will automatically recompile your code whenever you make updates.
