## Getting Started with React Project.

#### These are the steps to Setup React Project:
**Step 1.** Ensure that you have the most recent version of Node installed. If not, visit ``` https://nodejs.org/en/download``` to download and install the LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.  

**Step 2.** Verify that you have the latest version of VSCode. If you donâ€™t, go to ``` https://code.visualstudio.com/download ``` to get the version suitable for your operating system.  
    
**Step 3.** Open a Terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you want to set up your React project. If you're unsure how to do this, you might want to refer back to earlier lessons or use CodeSandbox as an alternative.
  
**Step 4.** Generate a Vite application by executing the following command in your Terminal or Command Prompt:
```http
  npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react
```
**Step 5.** Since Vite isn't installed initially, type y to continue with the setup. Next, you'll be prompted to choose a framework. Use the down arrow key to select React.
